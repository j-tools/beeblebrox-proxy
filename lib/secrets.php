// A password is hashed, because nothing ever needs it back. A webhook signing secret is the
// opposite: checking a signature means producing the same HMAC the dispatcher produced, so it needs
// the plaintext. It cannot be hashed and must not sit in the database in the clear, so it is
// encrypted under SECRET_KEY — which lives in the environment and never in the database, so a
// database dump on its own is not a credential breach.
//
// Losing SECRET_KEY means the stored secret has to be entered again, which is a minute's work here:
// this proxy holds nothing else, and it forwards perfectly well holding nothing at all.

// The raw 32 bytes AES-256 needs, derived from whatever form the configured key takes.

// A 64-character hex string — what the runbook tells you to generate — is used as the 32 bytes it
// represents. Anything else is hashed to 32 bytes, so a key somebody typed by hand still works rather
// than failing on a length check.
