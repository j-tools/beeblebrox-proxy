//
// The number is asked of GitHub's releases API rather than of the website. The release workflow tags
// every build there, so it is the one place that cannot be stale — the website is a separately built
// static image and would go out of date the moment this repository releases without it.
//
// Asked at most once a day, from a page render, and only ever while somebody is signed in and
// looking at the drawer. Deliberately never from hook.php: an envelope on its way to the worker must
// not wait on GitHub being up, and that is the one path a stranger can make run.
